### NEW NOTE (6/13/22)
This repo is now being deprecated. I won't disclose more information but we have baiscally another resource now into peeking into the full D3DMESH file format, and while that is in the works and will replace this repo when the time comes, this old repo will be deprecated and soon archived. The goal of this was to take RTB's 3Ds max script and generate a simple OBJ converter, and while it technically works there are a LOT of issues with it and it's not perfect at all. 

# D3DMESH-Converter
This is an application designed for converting **.d3dmesh models (Telltale Tool Models)**, to a standard model format (.OBJ and more...) 

**(THIS PART IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)** It can also do the opposite and can be used to do model mods for a Telltale Tool Game.

This app is a translation of [Random Talking Bush's Telltale All In One Model Importer](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11687&sid=6f8042ba574b8db30c500fe4520a66fc) which was originally written in MaxScript (Autodesk 3DS Max), but for various reasons I wanted to translate the script into a standalone application which requires no extra tools or resources, eliminating the need for 3DS Max, and rewritten to be far more readable and easy to understand.

A lot of the code will be very similar to what RTB has done in his original MaxScript, However I've made some modifications to simplify and break down his script into smaller chunks.

## DISCLAIMER (Please Read)
**This project is a heavy work in progress.** There won't be a GUI standalone release for a long while until functionality wise it's mostly completed and works as planned. Currently as I'm still translating RTB'S absurdly long MaxScript, (11769 LINES!!!!!!!) not all of the games will be supported just yet as I'm prioritizing versions of games that I currently have installed. 

ATM those are 
- Version 5: The Walking Dead Season 1 [PC]
- Version 55: The Walking Dead: The Final Season, The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series
