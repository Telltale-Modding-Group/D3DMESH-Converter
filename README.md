# D3DMESH-Converter
This is an application designed for converting **.d3dmesh models (Telltale Tool Models)**, to a standard model format (.OBJ and more...) 

**(THIS PART IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)** It can also do the opposite and can be used to do model mods for a Telltale Tool Game.

This app is a translation of [Random Talking Bush's Telltale All In One Model Importer](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11687&sid=6f8042ba574b8db30c500fe4520a66fc) which was originally written in MaxScript (Autodesk 3DS Max), but for various reasons I wanted to translate the script into a standalone application which requires no extra tools or resources, eliminate the need for 3DS Max, and rewritten to be far more readable and easy to understand.

## DISCLAIMER (Please Read)
This project is a heavy work in progress, there won't be a GUI standalone release for a long while until functionality wise it's mostly completed and works as planned. Currently as I'm still translating RTB'S absurdly long MaxScript, (11769 LINES!!!!!!!) not all of the games will be supported just yet as I'm prioritizing versions of games that I currently have installed. 

ATM those are 
- Version 5: The Walking Dead Season 1 [PC]
- Version 55: The Walking Dead: The Final Season, The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series

NOTE TO Random Talking Bush: 
If you are reading this... I hope you forgive me if your pissed about this project being a thing for whatever reason... I wanted to "de-magic-ify" your script, clean it up as much as I can, but mainly to understand better what the heck the D3DMESH format is, and given that your script is only resource on the internet that "documents" the D3DMESH file format there isn't much else that I can look to. If you are in town also, could you please hit me up and also help me understand as to why you did certain things in the script to get things working?
